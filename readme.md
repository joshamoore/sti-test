## Description
This application uses AngularJS, SASS, Bootstrap and Google Fonts. The layout is based off of the wireframe. There are 2 versions available, one with views and one without.

## Instructions
#### Option 1 - No views:
- All files are already in proper directories
- /scss/style.scss is available for modifying variables
- Open up widget.html in your browser

#### Option 2 - With views:
- HTTP Server required (WAMP available at http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
- Create a local directory
- Add sti-test folder to directory
- Connect to sti-test/widget-mvc.html

#### Option 3:
I've hosted it on my personal space at http://web.cs.dal.ca/~josh/sti-test/widget-mvc.html, you can view the MVC version live here.

## Notes
- Application was developed according to dimensions of wireframe
- To modify widget width, change $width value in scss/style.scss and remember that there is 10px of padding
- Site will resize on screens 768px wide and lower
